# SirBook Backend

## Overview
SirBook is a social media platform that allows users to create profiles, share posts, and interact with others through comments and likes. This repository contains the backend server built with Node.js and Express, which handles API requests and interacts with a separate database server using Python.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Authentication method for secure user login.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and post data (accessed via a separate Python server).
